  <h1>about aloft software</h1>
  <p>
    Aloft Software is a one-man freelance software development business that I started in the summer
    of 2020 when I moved to Bozeman. So far, I've completed projects for multiple happy clients.
    These include a musician homepage, a private social network, and consulting for a nonprofit.
